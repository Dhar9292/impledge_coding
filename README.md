                                              Program Overview:

1.The code uses a trie data structure, represented by the class TrieNode, to efficiently manage words.

2.It defines functions for inserting words into the trie and checking if a word can be compounded using shorter words.

3.The find_compounded_words function reads words from a file, constructs a trie, and identifies compounded words.

4.The main part reads the input file, identifies the longest and second longest compounded words, and records processing time.

                                             Design Decisions:

1.Tries are employed due to their efficiency in storing and processing words.

2.The code prioritizes longer words before shorter ones, ensuring comprehensive checks.

3.It's designed to handle any text file with lowercase, alphabetically ordered words.

4.Results are displayed in the terminal for accessibility.

5.A set is used to store compounded words, preventing duplicates and enabling quick lookups.  

                                         steps to execute Python code:

1.Install Python:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official website: Download Python.
Create Input File:

2.Create a text file named Input_02.txt in the same directory where you have the Python script. This file should contain a list of words, with one word per line, in alphabetical order, and all in lowercase.
Open a Text Editor or IDE:

3.Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Python code. Examples include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.
Copy and Paste the Code:
